Interfaces for DAL Abstraction in the Application to make UI Layer DAL Agnostic (low coupling etc)

Demo of Possible ViewModels (didn't see much point doing it for a small project, but you can see what I mean)

Ninject IoC Container Dependency Injection - Used to INjection my DAL Repository Implementations into my Controllers
(Should really be in some kind of service layer, controllers aren't supposed to contain business logic etc)

NBuilder - Used to actually build the list of test objects
Faker - Used to create some test objects with Team Names
Faker - USed to create some employee test objects
